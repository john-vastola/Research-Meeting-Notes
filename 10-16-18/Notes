---------------------
1:00 PM - 2:00 PM

Agenda:
----------
- Had a lot of trouble getting any kind of reasonable-looking LAP results from minimizing the action via Monte Carlo guessing. I think
  I am running into the `curse of dimensionality'. If you use paths with too many vertices, you will randomly search through path
  space forever and not find the result you want. If you use paths with too few vertices, your action minimization will give you weird 
  answers, because you are integrating over very jagged paths. The fact that your paths are too jagged is not helped much by enforcing
  a 'continuity penalty' (which would disappear in the limit of many vertices), as Jin Wang et al did in their 2011 PNAS paper. 
- Even in ACCRE, running for a few hours, it's hard to guess a good path. What can be done?

...

- I've decided to retreat back to an old idea. First, use the EL equations/Hamilton equations to find the LAP by solving coupled
  second order ODEs. Then you can calculate transition probabilities/moments/etc by doing Monte Carlo perturbations of the LAP you
  already found. The thing is, most of the paths found using the Monte Carlo only are useless: they are too far from the LAP, so they 
  contribute negligibly to transition probabilities. If all of your paths are 'close' to the LAP, then they actually contribute.
- Only issue (as I've said before): how do you solve the EL eqns without knowing the initial velocities? You'd like to choose them so
  that x(T) = xf and y(T) = yf.
- I think the only reasonable way this can be done is through systematic guessing ('shooting'-type methods). Working on this now.

- In service of implementing this numerically, I finally sat down and derived the fully general EL equations, along with some
  useful special cases. A write-up is in this folder. The math is pretty simple.
- Related: I realized that the fact that energy is conserved depends crucially on the validity of Hamilton's equations. But, in
  their usual form, one supposes that the canonical momenta do not depend on position, which in our case is not true. I realized
  that Hamilton's equations might look different when one has 'position-dependent mass' and some drift terms. 
- To be honest, I am still not sure if I have the story right. Do Hamilton's equations change, or are they the same? 
  Is energy/the Hamiltonian still conserved, or is it not? Is something else conserved?
- Want to figure this out first...


- I read one of the Weinberger papers ("Screening for noise in gene expression identifies drug synergies", Science, 2014). It says that
  using a noise enhancer on top of a standard activator/inhibitor increases HIV reactivation. This makes intuitive sense: bias the cells
  towards their intended destination, and give them enough 'push' to get there. Doesn't seem to be much substance beyond that.
- The more recent paper ("A post-transcriptional feedback mechanism for noise suppression and fate stabilization", Cell, 2018) I didn't 
  spend much time on, but the idea seems interesting: it shows a specific biological example of how noise is suppressed, through a 
  post-transcriptional negative feedback mechanism. This idea could be incorporated in the review as an example of how noise might
  be controlled.
  

  
- Any new thoughts on the local landscape definition?

- Still need to do:
  - landscape writing

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Meeting Notes:
----------------
- bet-hedging is controversial, if it included make it a very small part of apps with big caveat
- good to have some discussion (using as a resource, for example, Weinberger's "A post-transcriptional feedback mechanism...") of
  what it actually means to tune noise or deterministic part biologically
- probably have to do the chain rule in Hamiltonian calcs
- if LAP stuff takes too long, put it aside and come back to it later
- may want to leave technical/mathematical stuff (like math definitions) of landscape stuff out of the paper. Intuition from
  definitions we come up with would still belong. After all, journal is: "Experimental Biology and Medicine"
- (my) idea: maybe there are DIFFERENT local landscapes associated with different characteristic timescales. For example,
  imagine two attractors (1 and 2) very close to each other, and one attractor (3) far away from both of them. There are 
  two characteristic timescales: the timescale for transitions between 1 and 2, and the timescale for transitions between 1+2 and 3. 
  Maybe your local landscape reflects the timescale you choose. 
  Right now, the definition assumes you are only working with very short timescales. 

  Possibly: phi(x) < phi(y) if P(x0, x; t) > P(x0, y; t) for all t in [t1, t2]
  
  i.e. a local landscape requires a time interval [t1, t2] and a basepoint x0 in its definition.
