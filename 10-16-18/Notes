Agenda:
----------
- Had a lot of trouble getting any kind of reasonable-looking LAP results from minimizing the action via Monte Carlo guessing. I think
  I am running into the `curse of dimensionality'. If you use paths with too many vertices, you will randomly search through path
  space forever and not find the result you want. If you use paths with too few vertices, your action minimization will give you weird 
  answers, because you are integrating over very jagged paths. The fact that your paths are too jagged is not helped much by enforcing
  a 'continuity penalty' (which would disappear in the limit of many vertices), as Jin Wang et al did in their 2011 PNAS paper. 
- Even in ACCRE, running for a few hours, it's hard to guess a good path. What can be done?

...

- I've decided to retreat back to an old idea. First, use the EL equations/Hamilton equations to find the LAP by solving coupled
  second order ODEs. Then you can calculate transition probabilities/moments/etc by doing Monte Carlo perturbations of the LAP you
  already found. The thing is, most of the paths found using the Monte Carlo only are useless: they are too far from the LAP, so they 
  contribute negligibly to transition probabilities. If all of your paths are 'close' to the LAP, then they actually contribute.
- Only issue (as I've said before): how do you solve the EL eqns without knowing the initial velocities? You'd like to choose them so
  that x(T) = xf and y(T) = yf.
- I think the only reasonable way this can be done is through systematic guessing ('shooting'-type methods). Working on this now.

- In service of implementing this numerically, I finally sat down and derived the fully general EL equations, along with some
  useful special cases. A write-up is in this folder. The math is pretty simple.
- Related: I realized that the fact that energy is conserved depends crucially on the validity of Hamilton's equations. But, in
  their usual form, one supposes that the canonical momenta do not depend on position, which in our case is not true. I realized
  that Hamilton's equations might look different when one has 'position-dependent mass' and some drift terms. After running it around
  for a bit, I found out that energy IS conserved after all, but the reason for its conservation is a little mathematically different.
  So...no harm, no foul, I guess.


- I read one of the Weinberger papers ("Screening for noise in gene expression identifies drug synergies", Science, 2014). It says that
  using a noise enhancer on top of a standard activator/inhibitor increases HIV reactivation. This makes intuitive sense: bias the cells
  towards their intended destination, and give them enough 'push' to get there. Doesn't seem to be much substance beyond that.
- The more recent paper ("A post-transcriptional feedback mechanism for noise suppression and fate stabilization", Cell, 2018) I didn't 
  spend much time on, but the idea seems interesting: it shows a specific biological example of how noise is suppressed, through a 
  post-transcriptional negative feedback mechanism. This idea could be incorporated in the review as an example of how noise might
  be controlled.
  

  
- Any new thoughts on the local landscape definition?

- Still need to do:
  - landscape writing
