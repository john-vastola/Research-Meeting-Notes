9-13-18 meeting:
---------------------
2:30 PM - 3:30 PM

Agenda:
----------
- See the file in this folder for some brief comments on the paper you're reviewing.
- Finally read the Zhou and Li 2016 paper (10.1063/1.4943096) reviewing three landscape formulations, and discussing/clarifying how 
  they are all related. Lots of great info in there; I particularly thought the discussion of local vs global quasi-potentials
  (in section III) was clear and brought up a great point. That point is: different landscapes may be useful to you depending on the
  question you are interested in. Local quasi-potentials (derived from a path integral action/Lagrangian) encode (local) information 
  about the most likely transition path connecting two points/probability of transition between two points. 
  Global quasi-potentials (obtained here by gluing together local quasi-potentials) encode (global) information about the relative
  stability of attractors. The point is made that both kinds of information are, in general, not compatible---i.e. there probably
  isn't 'one true landscape'. 
  
- Made a rough outline for the landscape review article. For the most part, took your general structure (Intro, Landscapes, Applications)
  and expanded it somewhat. I think more attention should be given to the 'bigger picture' questions, which are: "What question are we
  asking that we want a landscape to answer?", and "What properties do we want our landscape to have?" These questions are related to
  how we are representing our biological system, so I want to make the points that (i) noise is qualitatively important to incorporate, 
  and (ii) landscape candidates should be somehow 'agnostic' to whether the system is described by the CME, or SDEs, or whatever.

  Landscapes we should discuss include: the P_ss landscape; discrete Markov chain-type landscapes (which are rarely identified as
  distinct from the others, but I've seen them used more than the others in practice); path integral/large deviation theory-derived
  landscapes; vector decomposition landscapes; and possibly others. I couldn't find articles that used ln(f) as a landscape.
  Also, the SDE decomposition landscape by Yuan, Tang, And Ao (ex: see 10.1007/s11467-017-0718-2) seems mathematically controversial.
  Zhou and Li "trash talk" it at least twice (10.1063/1.4943096 and 10.1063/1.4964682) by claiming it is not well-defined in general.
  
  Also, I think issues regarding using the landscape should be a separate section. So the "Applications" section is how other people 
  have used it, and the "The Landscape in practice" section contains talk about issues the reader might run into when attempting to
  use it.
  
- Read ~100 pages of a simple book by John Baez on the connections between stochastic mechanics and quantum mechanics 
  (https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3632). This sort of thing is exactly what I had mind when I have said at various times I think 
  the two theories are analogous. It discuss solving master equations using annihilation/creation operators, for example. 
  Why does this matter? Now I can better read/understand papers on the Doi-Peliti/stochastic path integral formalism, so that
  I can more rigorously justify my view on the Lagrangian etc. 
  
- Recall last week we discussed whether it matters that, in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, 'intermediate' paths are kept. 
  I read in some detail on article on numerically implementing it (10.1119/1.5024926), and it seems like it does. Auto-correlations
  between the paths used affect error bars and how quickly your results converge to the right answer.
- I modified the algorithm to include several tweaks (path 'thermalization', discarding paths to reduce auto-correlation) but it is too
  slow to run on my computer with these edits. I'll put it on ACCRE soon. 
  
- Minor thing: can calculate empirical transition probabilities for comparison with path integral results. Reuse the same code from 
  empirical LAP calculation. See the picture included in this folder.
- Minor thing: did the KDE. Looks as expected. See the picture in this folder.

- Will answer questions regarding if only sig_x/sig_y matters and get better plots once I put path integral and empirical LAP code
  on ACCRE. I have to relearn some of working with ACCRE since it's been a while.




- iMac okay?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Meeting Notes:
----------------
- piecewise FP model is interesting because it's next step beyond boolean; keep in back of mind
- will revisit some of the stochastic path integral stuff in the medium term
- computer will come eventually

For next week:
- overlay empirical path, calculated path, kde (all for one parameter set)
- put a bunch of stuff on ACCRE
- get refined version of outline once I get feedback
