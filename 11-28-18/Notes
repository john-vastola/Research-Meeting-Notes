11-28-18 meeting:
---------------------
2:00 PM - 3:00 PM

Agenda:
----------
- Been working on the review, although I stopped writing for now to give you a chance to do something with it.
  Lots needs to be done, but I am making progress figuring out what I want to say and how I want to say it. 
  We should discuss how we want to approach various things, though. What I sent you is in this folder.
- Been workng on the review reference list; I'm finding many, many citeable Jin Wang papers. He has made a career over the past decade
  out of constructing a simple model, calculating the P_ss landscape for it, and publishing a paper on that. 
- I also followed the citation trail related to his path integral/Lagrangian. It references some work in protein folding and some other
  things, which is interpreted Stratonovich-style (i.e. he cannot justify using the path integral/Lagrangian from those systems!). 
  An old paper he cites suggests that the Lagrangian/path integral is interpretation-independent, which is emphatically not true.
  
- Been working on writing the asymmetric noise paper too. Very early work is in this folder. Want to draft by end of semester.
- Converted all my histograms to KDEs, they look much better. See pics in this folder.
- Trying new method for finding LAP (explain). 
- Side note: additive noise seems to yield straight-line-like LAPs, while multiplicative noise seems to yield L_shaped LAPs. 
  (theoretical reason for this?)
  
- Still need to do: 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Meeting Notes:
----------------
- put together a figure explaining steady state probability distributions, transition probabilities
- consider looking at blood lineages as interesting application of landscape
- look at epithelial/mesenchymal stuff
- instead of finding empirical LAP, do a KDE of all the paths that satisfy the requirements and overlay the Lagrangian LAP.
  
- find 3 or 4 specific points that form subsections of the asymmetric noise results paper. Each subsection corresponds to one main
  point and one multi-panel figure.  (occupancy bias, directions of transitions, rates of transitions, ...)
  
- A. control, B. immediate experiments that get to point, C. secondary experiment that verifies main result, D. cartoon or pretty pic

- take a look at multistable (3-4 attractors) system to see if you understand what's going on as far as preferentially driven
  transitions and landscape
- consider how you will incorporate the added hill functions (currently they are multiplied)

For next week:
