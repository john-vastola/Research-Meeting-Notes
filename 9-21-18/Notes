9-21-18 meeting:
---------------------
2:00 PM - 3:00 PM

Agenda:
----------
- I responded to each of your comments and emailed you my responses; I also slightly updated the outline to include some 
  recommended changes. Some other points I'd like to discuss with you. 
  My response and the updated outline are in this folder.
  
- Wrote outlines for the paper with Linghui and the asymmetric noise paper. I did write an outline for the asymmetric noise paper
  a long time ago, but I figured it was worth a revamp given some time and the slight change of perspective that comes with that.
  The outlines are in this folder.
  
- Wrote a little stuff that could go in the asymmetric noise paper or Linghui's paper. Very very incomplete, but in this folder.

- Related to writing, I've tried to adhere to a strict writing schedule (8-10 M-F), but I'm having a hard time getting into it.
  Will try to improve.
  
- Worked on a toy problem for no particular reason: finding the steady state(s) of a gene which regulates itself with Nth order
  feedback, given that mRNA + all binding reactions are at QSS. The problem is trivial for N = 0, 1. The problem is solvable but has
  incredibly complicated (exact) solutions for N = 2, 3. Not clear if the problem is (exactly) solvable for N > 3. 
  
  Can prove some interesting things though. For example, can prove that the steady states corresponds to an 'effective transcription
  rate' k_eff which satisfies k_min <= k_eff <= k_max. In other words, naively expect that the 'true' transcription output is some kind
  of appropriately weighted average over k_1, ..., k_N; this result formalizes that expectation. 
  
- Didn't get stuff on ACCRE or do some of the things I promised. I had an off week; I apologize.

- What did you think of my hasty comments on that paper?

- iMac
