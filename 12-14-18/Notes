12-14-18 meeting:
---------------------
11:00 AM - 12:00 PM

Agenda:
----------
- This week, focused mainly on getting Linghui's project to a good point. Happy that I did, but that means basically no
  progress on other things. Sorry. 
- Working on finding deterministically bistable parameter sets, have written some notes on things I've found. 
- Learned yesterday when multiplicative noise can destabilize an attractor. (Explain)
- Did you think about the energy consumption vs non-gradient dynamics thing? (not important, but I thought it was interesting)
  
- Still need to do: LAP KDE thing with Lagrangian LAP superimposed, work on review, etc etc



PLAN FOR DECEMBER-JANUARY:
---------------------------
- Develop solid draft of the landscape review.
- Develop solid draft of the asymmetric noise paper.
- Spend some free time learning QFT/the stochastic path integral formalism.
- Plan some sort of timeline for next semester. Will be helpful developing hard(er) deadlines for myself.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Meeting Notes:
----------------
- get various direct simulation KDE landscapes done for tristable/quadrastable system: 
    - low additive, high additive, low mult, high mult (deterministically symmetric, look at noise asymmetry)
    (do this within a week)
    for tristable system, find parameter set with (lo, hi) (hi, lo) (hi, hi)    rather than third attractor being (lo, lo)
    if can make version with transition paths, make version with transition paths (but do the rest first)

- Meet next Thursday at 11

For next week:
