Time? 

Agenda:
----------
- Discuss landscape review restructuring. See short document in this folder. 
  Basic idea: focus on two questions important to differentiation/reprogramming, and describe with basic math how
  P_trans and P_ss answer those questions. Describe how different landscapes convey the same information. 
  One way that this approach differs from my earlier one is that it is more constructive: less 'don't do this and that' and more 
  'here is how you think'. 

- Transition paths for 4 attractor system. Discuss additive/multiplicative results. Discuss empirical KDE LAP vs theoretical LAP.
