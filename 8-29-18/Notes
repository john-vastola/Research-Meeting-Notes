Notes for 8/29/18 meeting

Agenda:
------------
- Any update on timeline for Wikswo review/perspective paper?
- Can we all use GitHub? (me, you, Cole, Linghui) How should we set it up? We should discuss this together.
- Linghui: decided to meet half hour Tuesday and Friday
- need to sign up for research hours but you are not selectable online. Who do I talk to, how many do I sign up for? (edit: Don 
  answered this, you are copied on the email)

- Unexpected issue with empirical calculation of least action path: it is NOT true that results for sig_x = sig_y = 0.35 are the same as
  the results for sig_x = sig_y = 0.55 etc. I predicted, based on the Onsager-Machlup Lagrangian, that only the ratio sig_x/sig_y
  controlled the shape of the path. What's going on? I suspect there is an issue with the way I am calculating the `most likely' path.
  
- generated program to calculating transition time distributions (doing it a little differently from before: in particular, calculating
   time until cell reaches final deterministic attractor coordinates +- small tolerance, rather than until cell reaches the outermost
   boundary of the final attractor. This is to facilitate easy comparisons with least action calculations.
   Plus the results do not seem to be much different (so far).   
- Here's the new way I thought to do it. The least-action path tells you the most likely way a cell moves from point A to point B
  in a time T. So you need to filter your paths: you need to find ones that make the trip in roughly time T, and whose destination is
  roughly point B. Of those paths, you can interpolate them (since they might not have the same number of time steps), and pick a few
  points in time to check. For each point in time, generate a histogram of the x and y values. The most likely x value and y value represent
  the 'least action' path at that time.
  The main issue is that you need to generate a lot of paths that make it through the filter. Working on this now.
- As far as generating Lagrangian-derived least action paths, I experimented with some simple systems on paper to get intuition. 
  Even if you can find an analytic solution, there is the matter of determining one of the arbitrary constants (which depends on the
  final location, and the total time). Numerically, all the methods available seem to just have to guess that arbitrary parameter
  (in practice, guessing the initial velocity, which is equivalent) until it ends up satisfying the boundary conditions.
  That is annoying, so I will fix the start point, end point, and total time, and vary the intermediate points to minimize the 
  action (i.e. not use the Euler-Lagrange equations at all). Too bad, since I figured one could work out some tricks using them.
- still thinking about how to do perturbation theory to predict locally how the occupancy fraction changes with the noise ratio. Might
  not worry about it since it seems you have to be clever: perturbation theory with just the FP probability distribution is 
  conventional, but this is PT with the FP distribution appropriately integrated. 


- wrote up notes working out approximate SDE for single gene with Nth order feedback (assuming mRNA and all gene-protein binding reactions 
  are at QSS)
- wrote up notes deriving steady state probability distributions, peaks, and means, as analytic functions of all kinetic and noise parameters
  for birth-death process assuming exact CME, Gillespie Fokker-Planck, additive Fokker-Planck, and multiplicative Fokker-Planck; provides
  some insight, in this simple case, as to when additive/multiplicative approximations are justified. 
  General conclusion here: if mu >> 1, additive noise works fine. Multiplicative noise is not very different either.
  In fact, one should expect additive and multiplicative noise approximations to not be very different for a sharply peaked monostable
  distribution (the noise coefficients effectively become fit parameters). 
  But for multistable distributions, additive/multiplicative noise approximations will yield very different results. 
  Another good reason to think about a bistable switch.
