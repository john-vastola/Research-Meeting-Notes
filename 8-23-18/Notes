8-23-18 meeting with Dr. Holmes

----------------------------------------
On the agenda:
- discuss figure on occupancy bias created by multiplicative noise asymmetry
- not sure about constructing a toy model that would reproduce rel occ ~ Hill function
- next figure: transition paths? transition times? effects of deterministic asymmetry? 
- discuss short notes on how noise asymmetry can be created by bidirectional reactions in quasi-equilibrium (which contribute to noise,
but not to average expression dynamics)
- possible review/perspective paper on GRNs and cell state transitions, in the context of designing closed-loop control of cell (Wikswo)
- resuming work with Linghui
- check-in on how the software carpentry workshop went 
- funding question
- using GitHub to document meetings/research work

-----------------------------------------------------------

Think about doing perturbation theory or something to guess what the slope of the fraction vs noise ratio line looks like

Figure critique:
- think about figures in terms of size/importance
- may be interesting for juxtaposition: symmetrize noise and vary basal activation rate asymmetry
- think about one-column vs two-column figures: how will figure squeeze into 3 inch page? maybe eliminate whitespace, work on text sizing. 
- possibly move colorbar inward to create less hanging whitespace
- change linewidth to 1.5 (1.0 right now?)
- font: 12 for labels, 11 for tick numbers
- possibly add to panel D: theoretical slope around center via perturbation theory, horizontal line indicating 50-50
- DEAD WHITESPACE IS YOUR ENEMY

do transition path figure next. Get least action software up and running. Make the point that path shape is only sensitive to noise ratio.

Review article (focus: GRN and transition paths):
- think about reviewing landscape stuff
- special issue: want to put coherent account of stuff here, don't worry about stuff being discussed elsewhere
- can sneak in some Lagrangian thoughts

Linghui: dedicate ~1-1.5 hrs of in person time per week (1 long meeting or 2 short meetings or whatever), Holmes ~1 hr or less every two weeks as needed
make roadmap of what want to get done
case study idea: here's when additive is good, here's when multiplicative is good, here's when neither is good. here's why. 
Transition paths shapes/times/etc.
