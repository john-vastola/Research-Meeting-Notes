8-23-18 meeting with Dr. Holmes

----------------------------------------
On the agenda:
- discuss figure on occupancy bias created by multiplicative noise asymmetry
- not sure about constructing a toy model that would reproduce rel occ ~ Hill function
- next figure: transition paths? transition times? effects of deterministic asymmetry? 
- discuss short notes on how noise asymmetry can be created by bidirectional reactions in quasi-equilibrium (which contribute to noise,
but not to average expression dynamics)
- possible review/perspective paper on GRNs and cell state transitions, in the context of designing closed-loop control of cell (Wikswo)
- resuming work with Linghui
- check-in on how the software carpentry workshop went 
- funding question
- using GitHub to document meetings/research work
