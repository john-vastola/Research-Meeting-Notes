9-5-18 meeting:
---------------------
2:00 PM - 3:00 PM

Agenda:
----------
- Kind of want to write a short paper to practice writing papers. Still feel like I don't 'get' how to organize a paper and
  organize my time writing it. Idea: write short paper comparing various Fokker-Planck approximations to a birth-death process
  using exact analytic results. 
  
  Proposed title: Quantifying the accuracy of chemical Langevin, additive noise, and
  multiplicative noise approximations for a birth-death process via exact
  analytic probability distributions and state transition paths
  
  Results: Exact steady-state (possibly time-dependent if I can do the calculation) probability distributions for 
  CME, Fokker-Planck w/ Gillespie noise, Fokker-Planck w/ additive noise, Fokker-Planck w/ multiplicative noise
  + moments + modes + Lagrangian-derived transition paths

  Can submit to medium/lower tier journal; don't really care. 

- Implemented empirical transition path finder. Did the sig_x = sig_y problem go away?
  Not sure yet; still need to debug. 
  Path integral code is saying I have some negative actions (but S and L are nonnegative...)
  Empirical transition path code is coming along all right.
  
- Re-implemented path integral calculation. In the process of parallelizing it and putting it on ACCRE. 
  (in principle, Monte Carlo path integral calculations are highly parallelizable, because each path contributes to the
  transition probability independently of all other paths)
  
- Do you know a minimal reaction-based (without spatial dependence) model for chemotaxis? A lot of the models I'm finding 
  have space dependence, but there must exist a model (even an approximation to the spatial models) that is CME only. Want
  to have this for Linghui to work on.

- Submitted the McMinn final report 
- Do you have a GitHub account? Need to invite you as collaborator.
- Wikswo thing?
- Computer advice?
