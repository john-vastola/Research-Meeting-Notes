9-28-18 meeting:
---------------------
11:00 AM - 12:00 PM

Agenda:
----------
- I was able to come up with a reasonable definition for a global/local landscape. What do you think about it? Agree/disagree?

  What I've written up so far is pretty technical, and probably not fit (at least in this detailed a form) for the landscape review.
  But maybe some of it would be appropriate for a complementary technical article (on some of the math). 
  
  Wang's P_ss landscape is a global landscape, Huang's normal decomposition is a global landscape (in the small additive noise limit),
  LDT/transition path yields local landscape, can define Markov chain global/local landscapes. Everything seems to check out.
  
  See the document in this folder for a write-up.



- Still need to do:
   - get out of worker's block: get asymmetric noise figure done
   - write shitty draft
   - write clean/concrete outline
