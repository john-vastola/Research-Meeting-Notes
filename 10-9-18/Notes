1:00 PM - 2:00 PM

Agenda:
----------
- Finally invested some time in figuring out ACCRE again and set up a reasonably organized workflow (subject to improvement). 
  One of the issues I was worried about was having to rewrite programs to make plotting external (since you can't do graphical
  stuff on the non-graphical cluster), but it turns out there is a workaround. Now I can use programs without any rewriting.
- Now that ACCRE works, I sent Lagrangian LAP and empirical LAP calculations to it.
- Made some KDE + empirical LAP plots on my computer. Strange phenomenon: the points seem to be clustered differently from how the
  LAP looks. The lap goes straight left to the pseudo-attractor, then straight up. The KDE shows most of the mass in a less sharp 
  curve shape. Why is there disagreement if the LAP is, by definition, where most of the points are (at a given time)? 
  Then again, the KDE is all points at all times, so maybe some disagreement is to be expected.



- Still need to do:
   - LAP review writing
