10-9-18 meeting:
---------------------
1:00 PM - 2:00 PM

Agenda:
----------
- Finally invested some time in figuring out ACCRE again and set up a reasonably organized workflow (subject to improvement). 
  One of the issues I was worried about was having to rewrite programs to make plotting external (since you can't do graphical
  stuff on the non-graphical cluster), but it turns out there is a workaround. Now I can use programs without any rewriting.
- Now that ACCRE works, I sent Lagrangian LAP and empirical LAP calculations to it.
- Made some KDE + empirical LAP plots on my computer. Strange phenomenon: the points seem to be clustered differently from how the
  LAP looks. The lap goes straight left to the pseudo-attractor, then straight up. The KDE shows most of the mass in a less sharp 
  curve shape. Why is there disagreement if the LAP is, by definition, where most of the points are (at a given time)? 
  Then again, the KDE is all points at all times, so maybe some disagreement is to be expected.
  
- Also, spent some time last week deriving the chemical Langevin equation corresponding to a bistable switch with arbitrary 
  (and not necessarily independent) binding between the two species. In other words, X can bind to itself and to Y, and Y can bind 
  to itself and X, and the nothing is assumed about the forward/reverse binding constants in each case.
  Arbitrary order feedback is assumed: at most N_x protein X can bind to either gene, and at most N_y protein Y can bind to either gene.
- I wrote the notes/did the derivation in three stages: (i) mutually exclusive first-order binding, (ii) independent Nth order binding,
  (iii) fully general binding. All are included in this folder.
- Interesting related observation: in principle you can justify from first principles the choice of adding or multiplying Hill functions.
  Both seem to be valid based on the assumptions you make. 
  Ex: If binding is independent, highly cooperative, and 'most' transcriptional activity happens in the saturated gene states, adding
  Hill functions seems like a good approximation. 
  
- Any new thoughts on the local landscape definition?
- Any interesting conference tidbits? You mentioned something about Sui Huang.


- Still need to do:
   - LAP review writing
   - reading those two papers you sent me

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Meeting Notes:
----------------

For next week:
- read the Weinberger papers, experimental biologist's perspective on varying noise in order to improve controllability of systems
- lots of people are thinking about 'increasing noise' as allowing balls to jostle around more, so it can get out of a valley;
  the better way to think about things is that, by changing noise, you change the probability landscape
- get a polished outline
