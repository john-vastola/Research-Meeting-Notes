12-5-18 meeting:
---------------------
2:00 PM - 3:00 PM

Agenda:
----------
- Worked a little on the review thinking about your comments. (Discuss comments.) Not much progress though.
- Started to convert work on bistable model to tri/quadrustable model. Found some parameter sets that work, still need to examine
  transition paths etc.
- Generalized 1D steady state Fokker-Planck solver to work with arbitrary noise. Used it to solve Mexican hat potential for 
  additive and multiplicative noise. Trying to calculate transition probabilities as function of noise too; would be nice piece of a 
  figure. (Discuss time issue.)
  
- Still need to do: LAP KDE thing with Lagrangian LAP superimposed
